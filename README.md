- The Stata code by Eleanor Murray and Roger Logan is available [here](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1268/2019/11/stata_part2.zip)
- The book by by Hernán MA and Robins JM is available [here](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/)
- These files are rendered using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).

## Install dependencies

- If you have downloaded/forked this repository you can install the R dependencies with (assuming your working directory is at the top level of the repo):

  ```r
  # install.packages("devtools") # uncomment if devtools not installed
  devtools::install_dev_deps()
  ```

- You can install the Stata dependencies, in Stata, with

  ```stata
  do depdendency
  ```

- For the pdf book please install the Fira Code font on your system from [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases)

## Building the book

- If you need to install LaTeX, in R install the tinytex package (which is included in the dependencies) and run

  ```r
  tinytex::install_tinytex()
  ```

- Render all formats

  ```r
  rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')
  ```

- Render the PDF book

  ```r
  rmarkdown::render_site(output_format = 'bookdown::pdf_book', encoding = 'UTF-8')
  ```

- Render the HTML book

  ```r
  rmarkdown::render_site(output_format = 'bookdown::gitbook_book', encoding = 'UTF-8')
  ```

- Render the EPUB book

  ```r
  rmarkdown::render_site(output_format = 'bookdown::epub_book', encoding = 'UTF-8')
  ```

- Preview a specific chapter

  ```r
  bookdown::preview_chapter("chapter-filename.Rmd")
  ```

- To build the chapters containing Stata code:

  - You need Stata installed on your machine.
  - You need to install Doug Hemken's [**Statamarkdown**](https://github.com/Hemken/Statamarkdown) package, which is now on CRAN and is installed when you run `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, or install with

    ```r
    install.packages("Statamarkdown")
    ```

  - If your version of Stata is installed at a default installation location the **Statamarkdown** package will find it. If your version of Stata is installed at a bespoke file path you'll need to set the file path to with something like

    ```r
    library(Statamarkdown)
    stataexe <- "C:/Program Files/Stata17/StataSE-64.exe"
    knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.path = list(stata = stataexe))
    ```

  - Install the Stata dependencies, in Stata, with:

    ```stata
    do dependency
    ```
